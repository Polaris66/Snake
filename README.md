# Snake
Training Agent to play Snake using Reinforcement Learning.

This project is based majorly on this series of youtube tutorials - https://youtu.be/PJl4iabBEz0

I have used pygame to make the game, pytorch to create the model and matplotlib (pyplot) to plot the training graphs. Even though I felt like I did not do enough original work in this project, I learnt a lot.

Using the algorithm ( Q Learning) in this project, I intend to "solve" many other games, including tic-tac-toe and maze.
